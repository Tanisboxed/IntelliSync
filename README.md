# IntelliSync Traffic Management System (ISTMS)

**A Multi-Modal Approach for Adaptive Urban Traffic Control**

Developed as part of the *BCSE316L: Digital Assessment-2 (Winter Semester 2024-25)* by **Tanisha Jauhari** and **Kunj Goel**, the **IntelliSync Traffic Management System (ISTMS)** presents a hybrid, fault-tolerant solution to modern urban traffic congestion using embedded systems and computer vision.

## üö¶ Overview

India‚Äôs urban centers like Delhi and Bangalore face severe traffic congestion, leading to $22 billion in economic losses annually. ISTMS tackles this with a real-time, sensor-integrated traffic management system that combines:

- Metal detection sensors  
- ESP32-CAM computer vision  
- Adaptive control logic  
- RGB visual indicators  
- Fault-tolerant system design

The system aims to reduce waiting time by 40% and provide 99.9% uptime using multi-sensor redundancy.

## üß† Key Features

- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Combines metal detectors and camera-based computer vision for robust vehicle detection.
- **Adaptive Traffic Logic**: Dynamically adjusts green light durations based on real-time traffic flow and vehicle count.
- **Visual LED Feedback**: WS2812B RGB LEDs inform incoming vehicles of signal status.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Operates seamlessly even if one sensor modality fails.
- **Embedded Control**: ESP32 microcontrollers handle local sensing and actuation, while computer vision runs on a connected laptop/server.
